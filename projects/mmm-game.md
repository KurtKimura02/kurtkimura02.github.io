Mars Mech Mission is a game that I helped create with a team of 5 for ICS 369 at the University of Hawaii at Manoa.

I was responsible for creating the game's 2D assets and 2D animations, alongside concepting ideas and providing suggestions on the game's balance.

You play as a man on Mars, and work to defend your base from droids by placing down turrets and traps.

Every night you survive more droids spawn to destroy your base, granting more resources to upgrade your defenses.

A playable version of the game can be found here:
