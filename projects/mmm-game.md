Mars Mech Mission is a game that I helped create with a team of 5 for ICS 369 at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. This was the final project for the class, where we were given creative freedom on what type of game to make. Our team decided on a "tower defense" style game where you have more interaction with the world.

I was responsible for creating the game's 2D assets and 2D animations, alongside concepting ideas and providing suggestions on the game's balance. More specifically, I created the player character's sprites, and the sprites which represented the two enemy types in the game. I created the concept for them, and let the team vote on the design of the player character.

Working on this game helped me learn how much time and effort goes into creating assets for a game, especially those more complex than pixel art. I had to learn how to make compromises between time pressures and going out of hand with concepts. It also helped me learn how to work with a team, and discuss and compromise on ideas for how the game should be.

You play as a man on Mars, and work to defend your base from droids by placing down turrets and traps. Every night you survive more droids spawn to destroy your base, granting more resources to upgrade your defenses. The game only ends when either your base is destroyed, or you die.

A playable version of the game can be found here:
