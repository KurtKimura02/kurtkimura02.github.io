Throughout my high school career, I took various leadership positions within Kaiser High School's Computer Science Club.

In my sophomore year, I was Vice President of the club. In my junior and senior years, I was Club President.

We taught club members the basics of various aspects of digital media, including programming using HTML, CSS, Python; alongside using programs such as Blender and Godot.

We also hosted workshops at elementary schools around the area, introducing students to coding through use of Scratch.

During my time as Club President, I learned how to host meetings, give lessons on programming, and how to manage a group during events and think on my feet.
