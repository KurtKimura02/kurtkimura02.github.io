Throughout my high school career, I took various leadership positions within Kaiser High School's Computer Science Club.

In my sophomore year, I was Vice President of the club.

In my junior and senior years, I was Club President.

We taught club members the basics of various aspects of digital media, including programming using HTML, CSS, Python; alongside using programs such as Blender and Godot.

We also hosted workshops at elementary schools around the area, introducing students to coding through use of Scratch.
