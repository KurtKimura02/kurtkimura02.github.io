Artificial Intelligence has seen massive growth over the past couple of years, thanks to the popularity of tools such as Dall-E and ChatGPT, and many programmers see these tools as incredibly helpful for their projects. ChatGPT is especially helpful for writing code and having the AI correct itself. But how helpful are they really? Throughout the Fall 2023 semester at UH Manoa, students in ICS 314 were encouraged to use ChatGPT for help on programming assignments. However, I opted to not use any AI tools while working on any of the in-class assignments, nor the homework.

## My Use of AI in ICS 314
Out of all the different types of work we were assigned throughout the semeseter, I did not use AI on the experience WODs, in-class practice WODs, in-class graded WODs, or essays. I also did not use AI to help learn a concept, answer a question, ask or answer a "smart" question, give an example on coding, or have it explain, write, document or quality check code. The only exception to this was for the final project, where a group member used AI to generate a logo for our website, which I traced over and cleaned up to use. Some of my classmates have used AI to help with shared assignments, but otherwise I have never directly used any AI assistance.

### Experience WODs
I did not feel it was necessary to use AI to help with these assignments.

### In-class Practice WODs
Rather than rely on an AI, I thought it would be better to practice figuring out what to do on my own to get better practice.

### In-class (Graded) WODs
Rather than waste time on trying to ask an AI questions, I just focused on doing the assigned tasks.

### Essays
I am fairly comfortable with writing essays, so I felt no need to rely on an AI to generate an essay for me, or have it give me ideas to write on.

### Final Project
While I myself did not use AI, a group member used Dall-E to generate a logo for our website. I, however, was not completely satisfied with the generated logo, and cleaned it up and made some changes.

### Learning a concept / tutorial
I did not find it necessary to use AI to help explain or teach something to me, as there are ample resources online which it pulls from. I would rather learn how to search for it myself, than rely on the AI to spit it back at me with its own, potentially incorrect, "interpretation".

### Answering a question in class or in Discord
I did not have any questions that weren't asked or answered by someone else in the class, or shown in the video tutorials.

### Asking or answering a smart-question
AI can't help with asking a smart-question when it isn't smart.

### Coding Example
If I can describe what I'm looking for, I'm better off looking for a human answer on a website like StackOverflow than asking an AI.

### Explaining Code
Learning how to read others code is an important skill, and I have not needed an AI to explain someone else's code to me in this class.

### Writing Code
Learning to write code is the most basic part of Computer Science, and I am perfectly capable of writing code myself, or finding better human written code online. I don't need an AI to do the searching for me.

### Documenting Code
I haven't needed to document code in this class, therefore I did not have to use AI for this.

### Quality Assurance
IntelliJ already has built in functions to fix ESLint errors, and if that counts as AI, then I have used it extensively to quickly fix the errors. Otherwise, I have never needed to use AI to clean up my code, as I believe it wouldn't be able to help.

### Other Uses
I tried using ChatGPT to help generate a good title for this essay, but I was greatly disappointed with the results. I think the title that I came up with, inspired by another person's use of AI, is much more humorous.

## Learning and Understanding with AI
I feel that the rise of AI tools has made it much more difficult to learn with others, and people who do not understand the technology well opt to rely on AI instead of finding study groups or asking questions. While I have not used AI at all to help with understanding concepts in this course, it appeals to the modern mindset of being able to quickly look up the answer to things, and have it spoon fed to you.

## Practical Applications
AI has been used extensively in many real-world products, typically to negative reception. Many advertisements I have seen on YouTube use AI generated images which look very sloppy to advertise their game, or simply to draw attention. Some game development companies have also gone to the point of firing a majority of their artists, and use AI to generate art for their games and advertising, with a few artists there to clean up the weird artifacts of AI generated images. Even big companies like Disney have had AI used in their productions, such as Marvel's Secret Invasion's opening credits being AI generated to give an "uncanny" feeling, and an advertisement of the second season of Loki using an AI generated background image. Once again, these received much negative backlash.

## Challenges and Opportunities
I see AI more as an obstacle to education than a benefit. With people relying on AI to do their work for them, students are learning even less in a time where people need to become more intelligent. People opt to have their code be written by an AI, and throw it into their programs without knowing what it does, and find themselves unable to troubleshoot in the future. It would have been better for them to just learn how to code it on their own from the beginning. It is also limited by what already exists on the internet, and while this course will not likely require a problem that has never been seen before, it has that limit.

## Comparative Analysis
With the way that AI is currently, I think it makes students less engaged with the work, and makes it easy to view assignments as obstacles to be removed by an AI helper than something to help you learn. Since students aren't actively thinking about the solution themselves, it also prevents them from remembering the solution later on.

## Future Considerations
I feel that having assignments where students are required to use AI could be interesting. While it would be hard to police, I think having students first write a simple program themselves, then repeat the assignment using AI to test its limits would help students learn the pros and cons of using AI.

## Conclusion
If it wasn't obvious, I am greatly opposed to the use of AI in education. However, I do think there is potential for it to be useful in the field of Software Engineering. I think that it can be a great tool, when used properly. But, I do not believe students are mature enough to use these tools properly, and will instead use it as a shortcut to getting an A. Its this improper use of these AI tools that makes me so greatly opposed to them.
