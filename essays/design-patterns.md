As any aspiring programmer works on new projects, they may come to find that they aren't able to find a good solution to a problem. So, they take to the internet to look up a solution. Many other programmers both new and old do the exact same thing. So, programmers made this into a concept to teach, known as design patterns.

Design patterns are concepts that can help create more efficient code, and can be applied to many different scenarios. They could be compared to learning specific drawing techniques. Like learning human proportions for figure drawing, or learning how to draw accounting for perspective. The concepts are building blocks that can be used as the base for a solution to a more complex problem. Knowing these patterns can help make programming significantly easier, and make a programmer more self-reliant.

## My Experience with Design Patterns
As mentioned before, concepts similar to design patterns exist in other fields as well. Like in art, I have learned design patterns such as the aforementioned perspective and proportions, alongside color theory and lighting. When it comes to design patterns in programming, I am still relatively new to the concept.

Most of my experience using design patterns in my code is from utilizing the templates provides for assignments in ICS 314. Utilizing Factory Pattern for creating objects, and prototype pattern for creating multiple instances of objects quickly and easily. While my use of design patterns is limited, with time I will find that more of these concepts show up in my code, and I will be able to more easily recognize them.
