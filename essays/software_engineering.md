As a kid I always wanted to create video games. Playing video games is my biggest hobby, and I also greatly enjoy talking about game balance and game design. This is what lead me into taking a game development class over the summer, leading to me jumping into coding and software engineering.

## My First Steps into Software Engineering

I first started Software Engineering back during middle school, where I first learned how to code in Java and made Minecraft mods. While none of these mods were particularly complex, this experience was what got me interested in continuing to learn programming. Writing and testing code over and over again was tedious, but having a final product to show off was what made me enjoy the experience.

## Into the Future

As I continue my pursuits into Software Engineering, I hope to get more familiar with the advantages and disadvantages of different programming languages. By learning JavaScript, I will be able to diversify my programming background, and have the ability to create websites with more functionality. This will let me more effectively display my portfolio in the future, and provide an additional way of showing off my coding capabilities.

I also particularly hope to learn more about game development in the future. I want to be able to program interesting game mechanics, and to create interesting games with stories that resonate with people. Creating games that are both fun to play and have memorable characters is my main goal.
