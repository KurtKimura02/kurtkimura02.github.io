Coding standards help to create clean code that is easy to read for other programmers. Having clear and easy to read code is also helpful for debugging and optimization. For some people, following coding standards is a chore, and seems like it only exists to arbitrarily slow down the coding process. To others, they're essential to writing good code and being a good programmer.

## My First Impression
After one week of learning how to use IntelliJ and ESLint's coding standards, I have found it to be quite tedious to deal with. Having to go through my code to fix all the issues can be a chore. It adds an extra step of tedium to the final steps of finishing a program. ESLint's quick fixes also don't always work unless you have a good understanding of what your code does and what needs to be corrected.

## The Observable Pros
On the other hand, I do think that ESLint has its benefits. By making the code easy to read the first time, it makes it easier to come back to the code later. It also makes it easier for other people to read and debug. During the coding process, ESLint is also helpful with showing errors in syntax, saving time during testing and debugging. Having clean code also helps prevent programs from becoming spaghetti code in the future.

## Final Thoughts
In the end, I think that utilizing ESLint's coding standards will help to make me a better programmer, and that it will take some time for me to get used to. With time and practice, I will become more efficient in writing code that follows these standards. My opinions may shift the longer I use these standards, but for now I believe that it is helpful, yet tedious.
