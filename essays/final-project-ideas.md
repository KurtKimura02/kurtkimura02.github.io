## The Problem
While websites like RateMyProfessor are helpful in giving a student information on how good a professor is at teaching, there isn't any way to easily find how good a course is. Some courses are flipped classroom, and some are taught exclusively by TAs, but there isn't any easy way to tell.

## The Solution
Our website will allow for students to rate courses at UH, and the professors who taught them. This would make it easier for students to decide if a course is something they would be interested in taking, or if it would be in their best interest to take another class. It would also allow for reviews for specific TAs.

Students will be able to create an account, allowing them to access all of their reviews in one place. These reviews would be anonymous, the account simply being a convenient way to view all of them.

Admins would be able to add new courses and professors to the system, alongside moderation of reviews to make sure all of them are appropriate and reasonable.

## Page Ideas
- Landing page
- User home page
- Professor search page
- Course search page
- Review page
- User review history
- Tutorial page
- Administrator permission page (ban hammer)

## Case Ideas
- New user goes to landing page, logs in, gets home page, sets up profile. (How do they learn how system works?)
- Admin goes to landing page, logs in, gets home page, edits site.
- User goes to landing page, logs in, looks for a professor and their courses, or a course
- Admin interacts to ban inappropriate usage.

## Beyond the Basics
- Student profile page (optional)
  - Anonymous, but shows the courses the student has taken
