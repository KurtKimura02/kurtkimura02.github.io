<h2 id="from-java-to-javascript">From Java to JavaScript</h2>

<p>Despite having learned HTML and CSS some time ago, I have never used JavaScript prior to taking ICS 314 at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. After covering the basics of JavaScript through freeCodeCamp’s lessons, I feel that JavaScript is very similar to Java, which I have used multiple times in the past. I learned Java first back in middle school to make mods for Minecraft, and went more in depth while taking ICS 111 at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. The syntax for JavaScript being very close to that of Java made going over the basics quite simple. However, I also found that JavaScript is much less rigid than Java, being similar to Python in this sense.</p>

<h2 id="javascripts-flexible-functions">JavaScript’s Flexible Functions</h2>

<p>JavaScript’s functions are much more open than those written in Java. JavaScript functions can return multiple different object types, instead of having one defined when creating the function like in Java. These functions are also allowed to have functions as parameters, and can return functions from functions. I found this to be quite interesting, and I think it is very convenient. While I am not sure how this can be used right now, I am sure that in the future I will be able to find creative uses. Overall I believe that JavaScript is a good programming language for software engineering.</p>

<h2 id="athletic-software-engineering-and-wods">Athletic Software Engineering and WODs</h2>

<p>For ICS 314, we have been doing WODs, or “workout of the day”s as exercises of our coding abilities. After completing a few WODs, I think that they are an interesting way of practicing programming. The first few practice WODs were fairly simple, and I have been able to complete this relatively quickly by having the correct idea on how to write the program. But I am worried that in the future I will come upon a WOD where I am unable to figure out the logic to create a working program, as I have a tendency to get locked into one solution when it comes to logic puzzles. I do think that WODs are good practice, as it helps programmers learn to think on their feet, making them more desirable as potential employees.</p>
